# PebbleSequenceTimer
PebbleSequenceTimer is a C app for the Pebble watch that runs without accessing an Android phone.
The app is used to help brushing one's teeth by vibrating every 30 seconds to indicate the
start of brushing the teeth in a quadrant of your mouth: quadrant1 covers upper, front teeth;
quadrant2 cover upper back, teeth; quadrant3 covers lower front, teeth; and quadrant 4 covers lower, back teeth.
After the quadrant4 has completed, a sequence of 4 short vibrations is given to indicate the end.
