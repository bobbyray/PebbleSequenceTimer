# PebbleSequenceTimer
PebbleSequenceTimer is a C app for the Pebble watch that runs without accessing an Android phone.
The app is used to help brush one's teeth by vibrating every 30 seconds to indicate the
start of brushing in a quadrant of your mouth: quadrant1 covers upper, front teeth;
quadrant2 covers upper back, teeth; quadrant3 covers lower front, teeth; and quadrant 4 covers lower, back teeth.
After quadrant4 has completed, a sequence of 4 short vibrations is given to indicate the end.
